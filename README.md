# DSCSEvoRandomizer
A randomizer for the digimon evolutions in Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth

# How it works

- Maximum number of evolutions/devolutions: Pick a maximum number of evos for each digimon. This setting is overwritten for Ultimate and Baby digimons in standard mode.
- Chaos Mode: Any digimon can evolve and devolve to any digimon, no level is checked.
- Random number of evos: Check this to randomize the evolution/devolution number for each digimon, using the number specified in the maximum number as the higher, and 1 as the lower.
